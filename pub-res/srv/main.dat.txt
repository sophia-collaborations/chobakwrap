:: This is the version of 'main.dat' that should be in the 'git-promulga'
:: configuration directory of the local repo for every contributing
:: developer working on 'chobakwrap' or any related project. To update it,
:: simply go into that config directory - and from there type the following
:: shell-command:
::     chobakwrap --out-promulga > main.dat
:: and probably more important - keep your local copy of 'chobakwrap'
:: up-to-date.
::
:: This version of 'main.dat' is not for the primarch of the project,
:: but for contributing developers. Also, it the primarch has intermediate
:: officers in the project, this version of 'main.dat' isn't for the
:: intermediate officers - only the contributors.
::
:: If someone wears more than one hat in this hierarchy - it may at
:: times be deemed advisable to have a separate repo (privately, and
:: if possible, publicly) for each hat.
::
:: It should be noted, that every local git-repo for development on these
:: projects should be configured to the following two remotes:
::     origin:  The public-repo of you, the contributing developer
::               (and it may need to be on GitHub).
::     official: The "blessed" repository of the project you are
::               wanting to contribute to.

:: The 'main' mode does rather little. It just syncs the dev branch
:: with your development copy.
