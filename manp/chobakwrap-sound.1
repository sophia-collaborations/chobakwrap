.SH DESCRIPTION
Different Unix\-type operating systems have different commands,
with different interfaces, used for playing audio files.
So as to make the task of playing audio-files easier for
higher-level scripts, this lower-level command acts as an
abstraction layer \-
a command who's usage is as much as possible uniform across
all systems for which it is implemented,
but which on each individual operating system does whatever that system requires
to get the job done.

Multiple implementations of \fBchobakwrap\-sound\fR come bundled with \fBchobakwrap\fR -- and a script invoked by the installer auto-detects
which operating system it is running on and installs whichever
implementation fits that operating system.
.SH OPTIONS
The options are processed in the order that they appear on the command line.
Each option overrides any earlier option to it's contrary.
.TP
.BR \-\-help
Displays this help file.
If this option is invoked, the program will do nothing \fIexcept\fR
display the help file.

It should be noted that while this help\-file is written in the
format of a \fBman\fR page, it's package does not actually
\fIinstall\fR this help\-file as a \fBman\fR page.
.TP
.BR \-\-help\-spc
This option displays the help-file that bears information \fIspecific\fR
to the particular \fIimplementation\fR of this command on your computer.
This option may not \fIyet\fR be implemented on every system's version
of this command \-\- but if it hasn't been, it needs to be added,
as it can contain \fIcrucial\fR troubleshooting information, including
information about
what tools a specific implementation relies upon.
.TP
.BR \-snd " " <\fIaudio\-file\fR>
The location of the audio-file to be played.
This option is mandatory (except in the event that the
\fB\-\-help\fR or \fB\-\-help\-spc\fR option is invoked)
- and each time this program is invoked, it can play only
\fIone\fR audio-file.
.TP
.BR -vol " " <\fIvolume\fR>
This option specifies the volume at which the audio\-file
is played - with 1 (the default) being the \fIfull\fR volume
of the audo file and 0 instructing the command
to be effectively silent.

If the system-specific tool \fIused\fR by \fBchobakwrap\-sound\fR
uses a different scale to specify volume,
then \fBchobakwrap\-sound\fR will do the conversion so that
the calling program can benefit from a uniform usage of this command.
